# snowcover_products

The snow surface is quite straightforward to detect from high resolution optical imagery. Discriminating cloud and snow pixels is the challenging part in snow cover mapping.

## Algorithms

Most of the algorithms are based on the normalized-difference snow index (NDSI) and a digital elevation model

### NDSI

The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover is an index that is related to the presence of snow in a pixel and is a more accurate description of snow detection as compared to Fractional Snow Cover (FSC). Snow typically has very high visible (VIS) reflectance and very low reflectance in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), a characteristic used to detect snow by distinguishing between snow and most cloud types. Snow cover is detected using the NDSI ratio of the difference in VIS and SWIR reflectance; NDSI = ((band 4-band 6) / (band 4 + band 6)). A pixel with NDSI > 0.0 is considered to have some snow present. A pixel with NDSI <= 0.0 is a snow free land surface (Riggs et al., 2016).
